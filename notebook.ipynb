Add pasta: Once the water is boiling, add the pasta to the pot. Use about 100 grams of pasta per person, or adjust according to your preference.\\n\\n3. Cook pasta: Cook the pasta according to the package instructions or until it reaches your desired level of doneness. Italians typically prefer their pasta cooked al dente, which means it should still have a slight bite to it.\\n\\n4. Make the sauce: While the pasta is cooking, prepare the sauce. There are various Italian pasta sauces you can make, such as tomato-based sauces like marinara or bolognese, cream-based sauces like Alfredo, or simple olive oil and garlic-based sauces. Choose your preferred sauce and follow a recipe or make it according to your taste.\\n\\n5. Drain pasta: Once the pasta is cooked, carefully drain it in a colander, reserving a small amount of the cooking water if needed for the sauce.\\n\\n6. Combine pasta and sauce: Return the drained pasta to the pot and add the prepared sauce. Toss the pasta gently to coat it evenly with the sauce. If the sauce is too thick, you can add a small amount of the reserved pasta cooking water to thin it out.\\n\\n7. Serve: Transfer the pasta to serving plates or bowls and garnish with grated Parmesan cheese, fresh herbs, or any other desired toppings. Serve immediately while it's still hot.\\n\\nRemember, Italian pasta dishes offer endless possibilities, so feel free to experiment with different types of pasta shapes, sauces, and ingredients to create your own unique dishes.\",\n",
