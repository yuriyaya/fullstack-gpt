There are also bombed sites with rubble and plaster dust in the air, as well as sordid colonies of wooden dwellings resembling chicken-houses. The specific appearance of Victory Mansions is not described in detail, but it is mentioned that from its roof, one can see the other three buildings that house the Ministries of Truth, Peace, Love, and Plenty.')"
